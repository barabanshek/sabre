# Artifacts for Sabre

This repository contains all 6 dependent repositories for artifacts for the paper ["Sabre: Improving Memory Prefetching in Serverless MicroVMs with Near-Memory Hardware-Accelerated Compression"]() alongside with the instructions to reproduce our results.

We also put all Serverless benchmarks used for the end-to-end evaluation. They are adopted from [serverless-faas-workbench](https://github.com/ddps-lab/serverless-faas-workbench), [SeBS](https://github.com/spcl/serverless-benchmarks, https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14132), and [vSwarm](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vSwarm).
